This is a script to open all the files in linux.
You need to add this alias: 
	eg.
	alias open=". /home/username/.scripts/open/open.sh"
then just need to write open 'filename" and it will open with the recomended program.
You need to change the script with your programs, for ejample in the script it uses opera to open pdf and webs.
